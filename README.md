# Logic Circuit Designer
This application allows you to design and simulate logic circuits.
It was created by Ovidiu Rădoi and Andrei Ivan while studying Computer Science at the Transylvania University of Brașov.
The application was originally released in 2009, and it was used by the students of the university to learn how logic circuits work.

The application supports the following components:
 - Built-in logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR, NXOR. 
 - Built-in inputs and outputs: Button, Led, Hex input, Seven segment display, Clock
 - User-defined modules that can be nested
